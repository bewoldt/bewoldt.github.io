    <h1>Brandon Ewoldt</h1>
    <p class="lede drop-cap">I have over 15 years experience and have worked across a range of disciplines including Interaction Design, User Experience Design, and Front End Development. It all began with a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Photoshop-6-WOW-Book/dp/0201722089" target="_blank">Photoshop 6.0</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031219225648/http://www.brandonewoldt.com:80/" target="_blank">Adobe Flash</a>, and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacer_GIF" target="_blank">spacer gifs</a>. Now I'm at home with Sass, Gulp, Git, and trying to teach the next generation of students how to make user friendly websites.</p>
