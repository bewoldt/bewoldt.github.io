The justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of their container.

**flex-start**: Items are positioned at the start of the container.

**flex-end**: Items are positioned at the end of the container.

**center**: Items are positioned at the center of the container.

**space-between**: Items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line

**space-around**: Items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.

**space-evenly**: Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects, before the first alignment subject, and after the last alignment subject is the same.
